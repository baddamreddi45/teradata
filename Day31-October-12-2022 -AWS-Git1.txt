Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are 
software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control 
systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development 
time and increase successful deployments.

Git is a distributed version control system that records different versions of a file (or set of files). It lets users access, compare, update, and 
distribute any of the recorded version(s) at any time. However, GitHub is mainly a hosting platform for hosting Git repositories online.

Git is a version control system that developers use all over the world. It helps you track different versions of your code and collaborate with other 
developers. If you are working on a project over time, you may want to keep track of which changes were made, by whom, and when those changes were made.

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and 
efficiency.
